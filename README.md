A number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players have 10 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback indicating whether each guess is too high or too low, displays previous guesses, and allows replaying without refreshing the page. It demonstrates core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.
